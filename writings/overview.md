Before diving into details, let's overview the landscape of GitHub Actions workflow vulnerabilies.

Why would the attacker hack workflows? There are at least two goals: (1) steal secrets and (2) modify the base repository in order to compromise the supply chain or users of the repository (e.g. place a backdoor or other malware). Technically, modifying the base repository is a special case of stealing secrets because the repository is usually modified with the `GITHUB_TOKEN`. Many workflows hold powerful secrets such as registry keys (npm, PyPI, DockerHub, ...), cloud credentials (AWS, Google Cloud, ...), and others. Thus workflows are critical-impact targets.
